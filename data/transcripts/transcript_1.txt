Alright, so here we are at the entrance of the property. As we step in, we're immediately greeted by a spacious, open-plan living room.

The floors are polished hardwood, which really gives the place a warm, inviting feel. Large windows line the far wall, allowing for plenty of natural light and offering a stunning view of the garden outside, with the distant sound of the ocean waves enhancing the serene ambiance.

To our right, there's a modern kitchen with marble countertops and stainless steel appliances. It's really sleek and includes an island with seating, which seems perfect for morning breakfasts or casual dining.

Now, if we move through the living room towards the hallway, you'll find the master bedroom. This room is quite large, comfortably fitting a king-size bed and boasting generous closet space.

It has an en-suite bathroom, which features a glass-enclosed shower and a separate tub, all finished in beautiful, contemporary tiles.

Coming back out and down the hall, there are two more bedrooms, each with ample space and plenty of light. They share a well-appointed full bathroom with modern fixtures.

At the end of the hallway, thereâ€™s a door leading to the backyard. It's a lovely outdoor space, very private with a stone patio and surrounded by mature trees. There's plenty of room for gardening or for kids to play around.

This property also includes a detached garage that could fit two cars, and it has additional space that could be used as a workshop or for extra storage.

Overall, the property is in excellent condition, offers a lot of space both indoors and outdoors, and it's in a friendly, welcoming neighborhood. Its proximity to the beach adds a unique charm, making it seem like a great place to call home.
